Since google form do not give the user a flexibility to add its custom javascript to forms for validations and add custom fields like adding calendar or google places api for address autocomplete. 

This is just a html file which would be integrated to google app script and served as a webapp. I have created a webapp from google services in my google drive. I would be updating the Readme shortly with the url and link to learn more. 

The purpose of this repo is to get data from users and populate it to spreadsheet. The form is easy to make with simple tool like HTML, CSS and JavaScript. Use google app script to integrate to spreadsheet and have the power of sheet.
